			"description": "Steve & Kate’s is a summer day camp founded on the belief that when you trust kids, they learn to trust themselves, and develop the creative confidence to unleash their true potential. So for 37 years, we’ve let kids choose their own adventure through a range of activities, including film, fashion, breadmaking, stop-motion animation, coding, music, dance, sports, and the occasional pie-throwing. Steve & Kate’s Camp offers a safe, judgment-free environment where kids can be themselves, explore their passions, and develop true self-confidence.",
